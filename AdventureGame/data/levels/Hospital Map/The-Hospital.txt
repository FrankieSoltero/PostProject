0:Hospital Entrance:This is the blistering cold of northern alaska, its snowing and you are prepared to enter the Hospital. To the east there is a small dark room. To the south there is a Dark Mysterious hallway.
1:Supply Room:You enter the dark room to realize its a supply room. You look around and see a weapon and item of some sort. You pick both up. The only exit is to the south which seems to be the Dark Hallway.
2:Hallway: The hallway is dimly lit, and the roof seems to be intact. You quickly scan the area and notice there are 4 exits. To the South there seems to be a big bright room. To the west theres a door that says security personel only. To the east there seems to be a stairway. To the north is the supply room.
3:Security Office: This room has lots of screens and what seems to be somethin useful. The only exits are east to the hallway and south to a room that has a Doctors name on it.
4:General Surgeons Office: This room is dimly lit and it feels like something is watching you. You scan the area and notice only one exit, back to the North to the Security Office.
5:Stairs: You walk down and notice a door with a plaque labled Reasearch Labs. You notice you are now down stairs. To the west you can go back upstairs to the hallway. To the east theres another dark hallway with wires coming down from the roof. 
6:Operating Room: You open the door and to your immideite surprise there is a massive zombie waiting for you to enter. You notice there is a weapon waiting for you behind the big zombie. Your only exit is to the north back to the hallway if you survive.
7:Downstairs Hallway: As soon as you open the door you notice a faint mass moving towards you. As you scan your exits, To the North theres a door named Reasearch Center. To the south there is a room labled Cure Lab with a lot of blood next to the door. Evidently the south exit is dangerous.
8:Reasearch Center: As you enter you get that same errie feeling you had when in the General Surgeons Office, something is watching. You notice only two exits; To the north there is what seems to be another office, To the south there is the downstairs hallway.
9:Chief of Reasearch Office: You enter assuming theres a zombie waiting for you because your luck with offices is bad. Your only exit is south back to the research center. 
10:The Cure Laboratory: You open the door and step in a puddle of blood, and look up and see the something you thought was a myth. You must kill it to get to the cure. The only exit is south to the sewer.
